## Rapid Learning Challenges

**‚Ä¢ What steps did you take to learn Swagger if you hadn't used it before?**

  - Investigate Swagger and how to implement it with Spring.
  - Compared different sources (YouTube videos, written articles, and updated guides) to grasp how to present an organized and professional documentation view.
  - Used Swagger editor template and corrected with AI help.
  - Continuous testing of the interface.
  - Consulted specific questions among several web resources.
  - Took brief written notes and saved useful links in a Word file for future reference.
    
**‚Ä¢ How did you resolve questions about Docker?**
- Compared different sources (YouTube videos, written articles, and official guides).

**‚Ä¢ What challenges did you encounter?**

  - Coming from a production support background, I realized that I needed to refresh and deepen my knowledge in certain technologies that I had not actively worked with for some time. This project gave me the opportunity to revisit those tools and concepts, and although it required effort to get back up to speed, it turned out to be an enriching experience. I not only reinforced my technical skills but also gained greater confidence in applying them in a practical context. Overall, I truly value the challenge because it pushed me out of my comfort zone and contributed significantly to my professional growth.
    
**‚Ä¢ What would you improve if you had more time?**

  - Stronger validations for Request Body and exception handling to cover edge cases.
  - Investigate more on how to leverage Lombok.
  - Implement bonus criteria (especially security)
  - Delve deeper on Docker and Swagger
